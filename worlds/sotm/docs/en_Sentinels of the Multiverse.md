config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Each villain (Including team villains) has a location:
- for defeating them,
- for defeating them on advanced or ultimate,
- for defeating them on challenge or ultimate,
- and for defeating them on ultimate.

Each environment has a location for winning in that environment on any difficulty.

Each variant unlock is also a location. (except for Completionist Guise)

There are options to change the number of locations in each of those groups, from 0 to 5.

It is recommended to play IRL or on Tabletop Simulator since some filler items will not be replicable using the digital edition.

If playing on digital, make sure to adjust the settings for what content you own,
and make sure you have all variants unlocked.
Variant unlocking needs to be tracked manually, it is recommended to refer to [The variant list](https://sentinelsdigital.com/variants).
If not specified to be regular, any version of the hero or villain can be used to unlock the variant, even if not normally possible.

The goal can be to defeat a number of villains, satisfy the unlock conditions for a number of variants, receiving an amount of Scions of Oblivaeon and defeating Oblivaeon, or any combination of the above.
