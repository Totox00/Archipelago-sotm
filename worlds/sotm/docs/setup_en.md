# Sentinels of the Multiverse Setup Guide

## Required Software

- Access to a way to play Sentinels of the Multiverse, such as physical cardboard and ink, the digital edition on Steam (not recommended), or through Tabletop Simulator
- [Sentinels of the Multiverse Browser Client (Requires no installation)](https://totox00.github.io/ap-sotm-client/index.html)

## General Concept

Since Sentinels of the Multiverse can be played as a board game, with the dedicated digital edition on Steam,
or on Tabletop Simulator, the client does not connect with the game itself. Instead, it will indicate what items you have received
and what locations are possible, and allow you to send those locations when you have accomplished them.

## Installing the Archipelago mod

The only client that currently supports all features is the browser based client linked above, which requires no installation.
Clients that interact with the game directly may be added in the future.

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

Simply visit the client site and enter the connection info and click connect.
Once connected, you can view received villains, environments, and heroes in the left 3 columns and mark villains, environments, and variants as done in the right 3 columns.
Hovering over an item or location will show filler items relevant to that item or location.
Global filler items are displayed when hovering over any environment.
Variant unlock conditions are displayed when hovering over a variant unlock location.

## Where do I get a config file?

~~The [Player Options](/games/Sentinels%20of%20the%20Multiverse/player-options) page on the website allows you to
configure your personal options and export them into a config file.~~ (This will only be possible if this is merged into main)
You can generate a template config file using the "Generate Template Options" button in the launcher once the apworld is installed.
